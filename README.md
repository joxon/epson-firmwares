# epson-firmwares

## Intro

After a recent update of an ESPON printer, my third-party ink cartridges are not longer recognized by the printer. I tried to downgrade the printer to the previous version, and yet EPSON has removed all previous versions of the firmware. [Matt](https://mattpilz.com/how-to-downgrade-epson-xp-printer-firmware-fix-ink-not-recognized-error-xp-300-to-xp-640/) has a pretty good repository for firmwares of EPSON's XP Series, but I could not find any downloads for my WF-4734. Therefore, I hope there is a place for archiving all other firmwares to fight against EPSON's policy of hiding all previous firmwares and their decision of making the printers not compatible with third-party ink cartridges.
